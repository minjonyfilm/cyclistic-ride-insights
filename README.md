# ðŸš² Cyclistic Ride Insights: Converting Casual Riders to Members

## Description

The project focused on understanding the usage patterns of Cyclistic's bike-sharing service to devise strategies for converting casual riders into annual members. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the ride data for the year 2021 to uncover insights into the behavior of both casual riders and members. The analysis revealed that while members took more rides, casual riders tended to ride for longer durations on average. Visualizations were created to further highlight these patterns. Based on the insights derived, several suggestions were made, including promoting the cost savings of membership, offering trial memberships, and leveraging usage data for targeted marketing.
